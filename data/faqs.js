    question: "What types of heat pumps are eligible for a rebate in Ontario?",
    answer: `Generally speaking, qualified heat pumps include:

- Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHPs), which transport heat from your home to the outside air.
- Cold climate Air Source Heat Pumps (ccASHPs), designed to work effectively in colder temperatures—ideal for Ontario’s climate.
- Geothermal (ground source) heat pumps (GSHPs), which use the soil's consistent temperature for heating and cooling.
- Heat Pump Water Heaters, which use heat pump technology to heat water more efficiently.

Additionally, the heat pump system should be properly sized to meet your home's heating and cooling needs.`,

    question:
      "Can renters apply for a heat pump rebate, or is it only for homeowners?",
    answer: `Since property owners are generally responsible for making permanent changes to a property, rebate programs are typically designed with them in mind. Renters are usually not eligible unless the property owner explicitly consents and approves both the installation and the application process. If you’re a renter, consider speaking with your landlord about possible energy efficiency upgrades.`,

    question:
      "Do I need to use a certified installer to qualify for a heat pump rebate?",
    answer: `Yes. In order to qualify for rebates, the heat pump must be installed by a contractor who meets the program’s eligibility requirements. This ensures the system is installed correctly, operates efficiently, and meets local building codes. Self-installations do not qualify for rebates.`,

    question:
      "What paperwork is required in Ontario to apply for a heat pump rebate?",
    answer: `Typically, the application process includes the following steps:

- Pre-Installation: Submit a pre-installation form to express your interest in the program. This may require details about the proposed equipment and your property.
- Installation: Have the heat pump installed by a program-approved contractor. Within a specified period (e.g., 90 days), submit a post-installation form along with:
  • Final invoices and receipts
  • Equipment details (brand, model, serial numbers)
  • Any required permits or certifications

Documentation requirements can vary by rebate program. Review the program guidelines or consult your contractor to ensure all necessary paperwork is completed and submitted on time.`,
